## Description

This EA is made for the MacD Crossover + 200 EMA + ATR Value trading strategy for a client. The entry conditions follow the standard MacD cross signals however 
due to the platform this was based off of the MetaTrader 5 MacD which uses a Simple Moving Average to calculate the signal line compared to the conventional 
Exponential Moving Average for signal line definition. While there is a buy cross and price is above the EMA the Stop Loss is set to the swing low plus the current ATR value and a buy market order is executed. Vice-versa for a sell signal. This system is profitable on select time frames and currency pairs, so contributions are
welcome!
